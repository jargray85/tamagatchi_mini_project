# tamagatchi_mini_project
This is a project for class

The object of the game is simple:

Keep your Artificial Intelligence (Sky-HAL-5000) at optimum levels by
feeding it information, debugging it, and allowing it to 'talk with friends'.

If it is at optimum levels by the end of the game (60sec) you win! (sorta..)

How do you lose?

Do not feed, debug, or allow your AI to communicate


HAVE FUN!
